Description: pytrx
        ==============
        
        Python toolbox for time resolved x-ray experiments. This is a wrap up of some of
        our (Chen Lab) experience with time-resolved x-ray experiments performed at
        BioCARS at APS. Currently it is primarily focused on the analysis of x-ray experiments.
        
        The library contains following modules:
        scatdata.py - toolbox for reduction, storage and loading of scattering data (**in
        progress**)
        scatana.py - toolbox for analysis of reduced data (**to be added**)
        scatsim.py - toolbox for generation of scattering profiles from known structures
        (**in progress**)
