Python toolbox for time resolved x-ray experiments. This is a wrap up of some of
our (Chen Lab) experience with time-resolved x-ray experiments performed at
BioCARS at APS. Currently it is primarily focused on the analysis of x-ray experiments.

The library contains following modules:
scatdata.py - toolbox for reduction, storage and loading of scattering data (**in
progress**)
scatana.py - toolbox for analysis of reduced data (**to be added**)
scatsim.py - toolbox for generation of scattering profiles from known structures
(**in progress**)
